# pz-seafood-trap
A mod which adds?/replaces? a trap to catch Crayfish, Shrimp, Oysters (Mussels) to Project Zomboid

Based on "Fishnet enhance for vanilla seafood（rebalance）原版渔网增强" (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2831806401) 

- Removed lobster, squid as they are salt-water animals. Keeping Oyster as there are freshwater mussels in Kentucky's waterways AFAIK, and willing to let that one slide.
- Bring back traps breaking, though much sturdier than vanilla fishing net
- Tuned down "Check Trap" results by a ton.

If addition instead of replacement:
- visually discern from fishing net

If possible without much work:
- Add bait to traps for better results (research)
  - Crayfish bait: any kind of animal leftovers, canned pet food, larvae?
  - Shrimp bait: fish meal, fish parts, flour, corn meal, canned pet food, tuna, chicken feed
  - Oysters: n/a
 
- Slightly randomize resulting catch's stats
- Add crayfish to Fishing.fishes as they can be caught with fishing rods
