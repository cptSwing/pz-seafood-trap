# pz-seafood-trap
A mod which adds a trap to catch Crayfish, Shrimp, Oysters (Mussels) to Project Zomboid

Based on 'enhence fishing net [...]'

- Removed lobster, squid as they are salt-water animals. Keeping Oyster as there are freshwater mussels in Kentucky's waterways AFAIK
- Add bait to traps for better results (research)
- Bring back traps breaking, though much sturdier than vanilla fishing net
- visually discern from fishing net
