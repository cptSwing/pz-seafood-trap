# pz-seafood-trap
A mod which ~~adds~~ replaces fishing net in order to also catch Crayfish, Shrimp, Oysters (Mussels) to Project Zomboid

Based on [Fishnet enhance for vanilla seafood（rebalance）原版渔网增强](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2831806401)

- [x] Removed lobster, squid as they are salt-water animals. Keeping Oyster as there are freshwater mussels in Kentucky's waterways AFAIK, and willing to let that one slide.
- [x] Bring back traps breaking, though much sturdier than vanilla fishing net
- [x] Tuned down "Check Trap" results by a ton.
- [x] Add crayfish to Fishing.fishes as they can be caught with fishing rods (just edited the original mod's file, not sure it's being loaded tbh and don't care for now)


If possible without much work:
- [ ] Slightly randomize resulting catch's stats
- [ ] Add bait to traps for better results (research)
  - Crayfish bait: any kind of animal leftovers, canned pet food, larvae?
  - Shrimp bait: fish meal, fish parts, flour, corn meal, canned pet food, tuna, chicken feed
  - Oysters: n/a

If addition instead of replacement:
- [ ] visually discern from fishing net
